# Ranking System Fix - Bronze Position Issue

## Problem Identified
Test employee was showing as Bronze (#3) when they should be in 4th position overall.

## Root Cause
The `getMedalStyling` function in `EditablePerformanceDashboard.tsx` was using the array `index` directly instead of calculating the actual performance rank among non-Diamond employees.

### Before Fix:
- Array positions: [Mahmoud #1, Ahmed #2, Soad #3, Test #4]
- Medal styling used `index` directly
- Test at index 3 was getting Bronze styling (case 2 in switch)
- This was incorrect because Test is 4th, not 3rd

### After Fix:
- Calculate `nonDiamondEmployees` array (excludes Diamond rank holders)
- Find actual position using `nonDiamondEmployees.findIndex(emp => emp.id === employee.id)`
- Use this `nonDiamondRank` for medal styling instead of `index`

## Changes Made

### Mobile View (Line ~1380):
```typescript
// Calculate the actual performance rank (excluding Diamond rank holders)
const nonDiamondEmployees = employees.filter(emp => !emp.diamondRank);
const nonDiamondRank = nonDiamondEmployees.findIndex(emp => emp.id === employee.id);

// Use nonDiamondRank instead of index
const styling = getMedalStyling(nonDiamondRank, employee.diamondRank);

// Fixed badge display logic
{nonDiamondRank <= 2 && nonDiamondRank >= 0 && (
  <Badge className={`${styling.badge} text-xs px-2 py-1 font-bold`}>
    #{nonDiamondRank + 1}
  </Badge>
)}
```

### Desktop View (Line ~1656):
```typescript
// Calculate the actual performance rank (excluding Diamond rank holders)
const nonDiamondEmployees = employees.filter(emp => !emp.diamondRank);

// Use nonDiamondRank for table styling
const nonDiamondRank = nonDiamondEmployees.findIndex(emp => emp.id === employee.id);
const tableStyling = getTableStyling(nonDiamondRank, employee.diamondRank);
```

## Medal Hierarchy
- **ðŸ’Ž Diamond**: Admin-assigned, highest rank (overrides all)
- **ðŸ¥‡ Gold (#1)**: Top performance among non-Diamond employees
- **ðŸ¥ˆ Silver (#2)**: Second performance among non-Diamond employees  
- **ðŸ¥‰ Bronze (#3)**: Third performance among non-Diamond employees
- **ðŸ“Š Regular**: 4th+ position, no special medal

## Result
- Test now correctly shows no medal (4th position)
- Only top 3 non-Diamond performers get medals
- Diamond rank employees get special Diamond styling
- Performance Champions section already had correct logic

## Performance Champions Logic
The Performance Champions section was already using the correct ranking:
```typescript
const nonDiamondIndex = nonDiamondEmployees.findIndex(emp => emp.id === employee.id);
```

This ensures Diamond employees appear first, followed by top 3 non-Diamond performers with correct positioning.
