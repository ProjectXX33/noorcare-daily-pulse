# File Attachment Download Fix

## Issue Description

Users were experiencing an error when trying to download attachment files from Employee Reports:

```
Error finding file: column file_attachments.file_type does not exist
```

## Root Cause

The `file_attachments` table was missing the `file_type` column that was expected by:
1. TypeScript type definitions (`FileAttachmentRecord`)
2. Database queries in the download functionality
3. Real-time subscriptions that fetch file data

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Schema Fix

**File:** `fix_file_attachments_missing_column.sql`

- Added the missing `file_type` column to the `file_attachments` table
- Updated existing records with appropriate file types based on file extensions
- Includes verification queries to confirm the fix

### 2. Code Fix

**File:** `src/contexts/CheckInContext.tsx`

- Updated file upload logic to include `file_type` when inserting new attachments
- Uses `fileAttachment.type` from the browser's File API
- Falls back to `'application/octet-stream'` for unknown types

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Run the Database Script

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_file_attachments_missing_column.sql`
4. Execute the script

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes

The code changes have been applied to:
- `src/contexts/CheckInContext.tsx` - Fixed file upload to include file_type

## Verification

After applying the fix:

1. **Existing attachments**: Will have proper file types based on their extensions
2. **New attachments**: Will automatically include the correct file type
3. **Download functionality**: Should work without errors
4. **Admin reports**: File downloads should work properly

## File Type Mapping

The script automatically assigns file types based on extensions:

- `.pdf` → `application/pdf`
- `.doc`, `.docx` → `application/msword`
- `.xls`, `.xlsx` → `application/vnd.ms-excel`
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg` → `image/jpeg`
- `.png` → `image/png`
- `.gif` → `image/gif`
- `.txt` → `text/plain`
- `.zip` → `application/zip`
- `.rar` → `application/x-rar-compressed`
- Others → `application/octet-stream`

## Testing the Fix

1. Try downloading an existing attachment from Employee Reports
2. Upload a new report with an attachment
3. Try downloading the newly uploaded attachment
4. Verify that both old and new attachments download successfully
