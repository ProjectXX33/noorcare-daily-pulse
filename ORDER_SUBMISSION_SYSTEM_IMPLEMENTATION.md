```

### 2. Customer Service Features ("My Orders")
- **Personal Dashboard**: View only orders created by the logged-in user
- **Order Statistics**: Personal metrics (total orders, revenue, status breakdown)
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search by customer, phone, order number, date range, status
- **Order Details**: Full order information with customer details and itemized breakdown
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh functionality to get latest data
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface

### 3. Admin Features ("Total Orders")

- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by customer service rep, customer info, dates, amounts
- **Dual View Mode**: Switch between Orders view and Statistics view

### 4. Enhanced Create Order Process
- **Dual Persistence**: Saves to both local database AND WooCommerce
- **Fallback Handling**: If WooCommerce fails, order is still saved locally
- **Order Tracking**: Automatic order number generation (CS-{timestamp})
- **Metadata Linking**: WooCommerce orders include internal order ID reference

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)

### Access Control

## 📊 Data Flow

### Order Creation Process:

2. Validation ensures required fields are complete
3. Order saved to `order_submissions` table first
4. WooCommerce order creation attempted
5. If successful: WooCommerce order ID stored in database
6. If failed: Order remains in database with sync status marked

### Data Retrieval:
1. **My Orders**: Queries filtered by current user ID
2. **Total Orders**: Admin queries without user filtering
3. **Statistics**: Aggregated data calculated on-demand
4. **Search**: Full-text search across customer and order details

## 🎨 UI/UX Features
