## 🔍 How the Restored Product Search Works

### **1. Automatic Detection**
The chatbot now instantly detects when you want to search for products:

### **2. Fast Search Logic**
```typescript
// Simple, efficient detection
const isProductSearch = 
  lowerInput.startsWith('search ') || 
  /^(ما هو|what is|أريد|i want)\s+/i.test(originalInput) ||
  (hasProductLikeContent && !isGreeting);
```

### **3. WooCommerce Integration**
- Real product data from your store
