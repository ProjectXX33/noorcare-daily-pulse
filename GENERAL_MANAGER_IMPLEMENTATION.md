## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
1. **SQL File**: `add_general_manager_role.sql`
   - Updates position constraint to include "General Manager"
   - Maintains all existing positions
   - Provides verification queries

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)
```typescript
export type Position = 'Junior CRM Specialist' | 'Senior CRM Pharmacist' | 'Designer' | 'Media Buyer' | 'Content Creator' | 'Web Developer' | 'Warehouse Staff' | 'Executive Director' | 'Content & Creative Manager' | 'Customer Retention Manager' | 'IT Manager' | 'E-commerce Manager' | 'Digital Solution Manager' | 'General Manager';
```

#### 2. Route Guards (`src/App.tsx`)
All route guard components now include General Manager bypass:
- **AdminRoute**: Full access to admin-only routes
- **EmployeeRoute**: Full access to employee routes
- **EmployeeDashboardRoute**: Full access to employee dashboard
- **CustomerServiceRoute**: Full access to customer service routes

- **Bypass Logic**: Added to both item and group filtering functions

#### 4. Chatbot Access (`src/components/FloatingChatbot.tsx`)
- **Hover Effects**: General Manager can hover over chatbot
- **Click Access**: General Manager can open and use chatbot
- **Toast Messages**: Updated to include General Manager in access list

#### 5. Admin Interface Updates
- **AdminEmployeesPage.tsx**: Position dropdowns include "General Manager"
- **AdminShiftManagement.tsx**: Position dropdowns include "General Manager"

### Access Control Pattern
The implementation follows the same pattern used for Digital Solution Manager:

```typescript
// Example from route guards
if (user?.position === 'Digital Solution Manager' || user?.position === 'General Manager') {
  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

This pattern ensures that General Manager has the same unlimited access as Digital Solution Manager.
