## 📱 User Interface

### **Break Button Flow**
1. Employee checks in → Break Time button appears (yellow)
2. Click "Break Time" → Modal asks for reason
3. Enter reason → Click "Start Break" → Button turns orange "Stop Break"
4. During break → Work timer shows "ON BREAK", break timer counts up
5. Click "Stop Break" → Work timer resumes, break logged

### **Visual Indicators**
- 🟡 **Yellow Button**: "Break Time" (available)
- 🟠 **Orange Button**: "Stop Break" (currently on break)
- 🟠 **Orange Timer**: "ON BREAK - Work time paused"
- 📊 **Break History**: Shows in Recent Check-ins with full details

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### **New Columns in `check_ins` table:**
```sql
- break_start_time (TIMESTAMP)
- break_end_time (TIMESTAMP)  
- total_break_minutes (INTEGER)
- is_on_break (BOOLEAN)
- current_break_reason (TEXT)
- break_sessions (JSONB array)
```

### **Break Session Format:**
```json
{
  "start_time": "2025-01-09T14:30:00Z",
  "end_time": "2025-01-09T15:00:00Z", 
  "duration_minutes": 30,
  "reason": "Lunch break"
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Components Updated:**
- ✅ `BreakTimeButton.tsx` - New component with reason dialog
- ✅ `CheckInPage.tsx` - Integrated break button and enhanced check-ins display
- ✅ `WorkShiftTimer.tsx` - Work time freezing logic and break status
- ✅ `CheckInContext.tsx` - Break data fetching and mapping

### **Work Time Logic:**
```typescript
if (isOnBreak) {
  // Freeze work time at value before break started
  setTimeWorked(workTimeBeforeBreak);
} else {
  // Calculate actual work time excluding all break time
  const actualWorkTime = totalElapsedTime - totalBreakTime;
  setTimeWorked(actualWorkTime);
}
```

## 📋 Usage Instructions
