# Background Loyal Customers Processing

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. **Background Processing**
- ✅ **Continue working while data loads** - Navigate to any page and the process continues
- ✅ **Visual progress indicator** - Shows on all pages during processing
- ✅ **No interruptions** - Process runs independently in background

### 2. **All-Time Analysis** 
- ✅ **Complete customer history** - Analyzes ALL orders, not just recent ones
- ✅ **True top 50** - Processes ALL customers to find real top spenders
- ✅ **Comprehensive data** - Includes complete order history for accurate ranking

## 🎯 How It Works

### Background Context System
- **Global State**: Uses React Context to maintain state across all pages
- **Persistent Processing**: Continues even when navigating away from Loyal Customers page
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress updates in real-time with floating indicator

### All-Time Data Collection
```typescript
// Fetches ALL customers (not limited to recent registrations)
while (hasMore) {
  const customers = await fetchCustomers({ page: currentPage });
  // Process each page...
}

// For each customer, gets ALL their orders (complete history)
while (hasMoreOrders) {
  const orders = await fetchOrdersForCustomer(customerId, { page: orderPage });
  // Collect complete order history...
}
```

## 📊 Data Processing Flow

1. **📥 Customer Download (0-60%)**
   - Fetches ALL customers via pagination
   - No date restrictions - gets complete customer database

2. **🔍 Order Analysis (60-90%)**
   - For each customer, fetches ALL their orders
   - Processes complete order history for accurate spending calculation
   - Calculates true all-time metrics

3. **🏆 Final Ranking (90-100%)**
   - Sorts by ALL-TIME spending (not monthly)
   - Selects true top 50 customers by lifetime value
   - Displays ranked by total historical spending

## 🎨 User Experience

### Background Indicator

- **Behavior**: Only appears during processing, hides when complete

### Page Behavior

## 📈 Performance Features

  details: string;                // Detailed progress info
