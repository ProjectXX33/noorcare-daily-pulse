# Warehouse Role Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Warehouse role has been implemented to provide order management functionality for warehouse staff without access to the main navigation sidebar. This creates a focused, distraction-free interface for order processing.

## Features Implemented

### 1. New User Role
- Added `warehouse` to the user role types (`admin` | `employee` | `warehouse`)
- Added `Warehouse Staff` position type
- Updated all relevant type definitions and API functions

### 2. Warehouse Dashboard (`/warehouse-dashboard`)
- **Clean Interface**: No sidebar navigation - focused on order management only
- **Real-time Order Updates**: Live subscription to new orders from WooCommerce
- **Order Management**: Full CRUD operations for order status and notes
- **Search & Filter**: Filter by status, search by order number, customer name, or phone
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for new orders

### 3. Order Management Features

#### Status Management
- Update order status: `pending`, `processing`, `shipped`, `delivered`, `cancelled`, `refunded`, `on-hold`
- Add reasons when changing status (especially for cancellations)
- Track status change history

#### Notes System
- Add warehouse notes to orders
- View all order notes with timestamps
- Automatic notes when status changes with reasons

#### Order Details
- Complete customer information
- Order items breakdown
- Payment summary
- Status history
- Notes history

### 4. Real-time Features
- **New Order Notifications**: Toast notifications when new orders arrive
- **Live Updates**: Orders list updates automatically
- **Notification Counter**: Visual indicator for new orders
- **Auto-refresh**: Background updates without manual refresh

## Database Tables Created

### `order_notes`
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- order_id (BigInt, Foreign Key to order_submissions)
- note (Text)
- created_by (UUID, Foreign Key to users)
- created_by_name (VARCHAR)
- note_type (ENUM: general, status_change, cancel_reason, warehouse)
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)
```

### `order_status_history`
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- order_id (BigInt, Foreign Key to order_submissions)
- old_status (VARCHAR)
- new_status (VARCHAR)
- reason (Text, Optional)
- changed_by (UUID, Foreign Key to users)
- changed_by_name (VARCHAR)
- changed_at (Timestamp)
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
```sql
-- Execute the warehouse management tables SQL
-- File: create_warehouse_management_tables.sql
```

### 2. Create Warehouse Users
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Employee Management
3. Click "Add Employee"
4. Set Role to "Warehouse"
5. Set Position to "Warehouse Staff"
6. Complete other required fields

### 3. Access Warehouse Dashboard
- Warehouse users automatically redirect to `/warehouse-dashboard`
- Direct access: `https://your-domain.com/warehouse-dashboard`

## User Experience

### For Warehouse Staff
1. **Login**: Redirected directly to warehouse dashboard
2. **Clean Interface**: No distracting sidebar or extra navigation
3. **Focus on Orders**: Only order-related functionality visible
4. **Real-time Updates**: Instant notifications for new orders
5. **Efficient Workflow**: Quick status updates and note additions

### Order Processing Workflow
1. **New Order Alert**: Notification appears for new orders
2. **Review Order**: Click "View" to see full order details
3. **Update Status**: Change from pending → processing → shipped → delivered
4. **Add Notes**: Document any issues or special instructions
5. **Cancel if Needed**: Set to cancelled with reason

## Security Features
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Warehouse users can only access order-related data
- **Role-based Access**: Strict separation between admin, employee, and warehouse roles
- **Audit Trail**: All status changes and notes are logged with user information

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components
- `WarehouseDashboard.tsx`: Main dashboard component
- `WarehouseRoute`: Route protection component
- Order management API functions
- Real-time Supabase subscriptions

### Real-time Subscription
```javascript
// Listens for new orders and updates
supabase
  .channel('warehouse-orders')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'order_submissions'
  }, callback)
```
