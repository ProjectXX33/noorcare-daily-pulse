# Customer Service Warning Note Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a critical warning note for Customer Service employees to ensure they understand the importance of daily check-in, check-out, and report submission for proper record keeping.

## Warning Message

**Text**: "If you do not check in, check out, or submit your daily report, that day will NOT be collected or counted in your records."

**Purpose**: To clearly communicate that incomplete daily activities (missing check-in, check-out, or daily report) will result in that day not being tracked or counted in their attendance and performance records.

## Implementation Locations

### 1. Check-in Page (`src/pages/CheckInPage.tsx`)
**Location**: Customer Service Check-in Instructions card
**Design**: 
- Red background (`bg-red-50` / dark: `bg-red-950/20`)
- Red border (`border-2 border-red-200` / dark: `border-red-900/50`)
- AlertCircle icon in red (`text-red-600` / dark: `text-red-400`)
- Bold "⚠️ Important Notice" heading
- Emphasized text with `<strong>NOT</strong>` highlighting

### 2. Employee Dashboard (`src/pages/EmployeeDashboard.tsx`)
**Location**: Below check-in reminder, visible to all Customer Service employees
**Design**: 
- Same red styling as Check-in Page for consistency
- Title: "⚠️ Daily Reminder" instead of "Important Notice"
- Always visible to Customer Service employees as a daily reminder
- Same critical message content

## Visual Design Elements

### Color Scheme
- **Light Mode**: 
  - Background: `bg-red-50`
  - Border: `border-2 border-red-200`
  - Icon: `text-red-600`
  - Heading: `text-red-800`
  - Text: `text-red-700`

- **Dark Mode**:

  - Border: `border-red-900/50`
  - Icon: `text-red-400`

  - Text: `text-red-400`

### Layout

## Access Control

- **Check**: `user.position === 'Customer Service'`

### Where It Appears

2. **Employee Dashboard**: As a daily reminder on their main page

### Who Does NOT See This Warning
- Admin users
- Media Buyers  
- Other employee positions
- Non-Customer Service roles

## Benefits

### For Management

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified
1. `CheckInPage.tsx`: Added warning in instructions section
2. `EmployeeDashboard.tsx`: Added daily reminder section
3. Both use `AlertCircle` icon from Lucide React

### Styling Approach
- Uses Tailwind CSS utility classes for consistent design
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Dark mode support included
- Maintains design system consistency with other warning/alert components

## Testing Recommendations

### Customer Service Employee Login
1. **Dashboard View**: Verify red warning appears on employee dashboard
2. **Check-in Page**: Verify warning appears in instructions section
3. **Message Clarity**: Confirm text is easily readable and prominent
4. **Mobile View**: Test responsiveness on smaller screens
5. **Dark Mode**: Verify proper styling in dark theme

### Non-Customer Service Login
1. **Media Buyer**: Verify warning does NOT appear anywhere
2. **Admin**: Verify warning does NOT appear anywhere  
3. **Other Employees**: Verify warning does NOT appear anywhere

### Visual Testing
1. **Color Contrast**: Verify text is readable against red background
2. **Icon Alignment**: Check AlertCircle icon aligns properly with text
3. **Border Visibility**: Confirm red border is visible and prominent
4. **Responsive Design**: Test on various screen sizes

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding this warning to shift management pages
- Potential to translate warning message for Arabic language support
- Could add timestamp tracking of when employees view this warning
- Possible integration with actual record validation to show real-time compliance status
