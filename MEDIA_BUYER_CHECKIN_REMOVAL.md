# Media Buyer Check-in Removal Summary

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to remove check-in functionality from Media Buyers while maintaining their access to calendar management and task assignment features. Additionally, the standalone Events page has been hidden from Media Buyers to avoid duplication with their dedicated Media Buyer Tasks page.

## Changes Made

### 1. EmployeeDashboard.tsx
**Problem**: Media Buyers were seeing check-in cards, reminders, and history on their dashboard.

**Solution**: Added `hasCheckInAccess` check that restricts check-in functionality to only Customer Service employees.

**Changes**:
- Added `const hasCheckInAccess = user.position === 'Customer Service';`
- Wrapped check-in dashboard card in conditional: `{hasCheckInAccess && (...)`
- Wrapped check-in reminder banner in conditional: `{hasCheckInAccess && !checkedInToday && (...)`
- Wrapped check-in history section in conditional: `{hasCheckInAccess && (...)`
- Made report history span full width when check-in history is hidden

### 2. Dashboard.tsx (Admin Dashboard)
**Problem**: Admin dashboard was showing check-in reminders to all non-admin users, including Media Buyers.

**Solution**: Updated the check-in reminder condition to also check for Customer Service position.

**Changes**:
- Updated condition from: `{!checkedInToday && user.role !== 'admin' && (`
- To: `{!checkedInToday && user.role !== 'admin' && user.position === 'Customer Service' && (`

### 3. MediaBuyerTasksPage.tsx
**Problem**: Import errors preventing the page from working properly.

**Solution**: Fixed import statements to use correct type imports.

**Changes**:
- Changed `import { createTask, fetchAllTasks, Task } from '@/lib/tasksApi';` to separate imports
- Added `import { Task } from '@/types';`
- Changed `import { fetchEmployees, User as Employee } from '@/lib/employeesApi';` to separate imports
- Added `import { User as Employee } from '@/types';`

### 4. Events Page Access Control (NEW)
**Problem**: Media Buyers had access to both the standalone Events page and their dedicated Media Buyer Tasks page, causing confusion and duplication.

**Solution**: Hide the Events page from Media Buyers since they have full event management in their dedicated tasks page.

**Changes**:
- **SidebarNavigation.tsx**: Added `excludeMediaBuyer: true` flag to Events nav item
- **App.tsx**: Created `NonMediaBuyerRoute` component that redirects Media Buyers to their tasks page
- **App.tsx**: Updated Events route to use `NonMediaBuyerRoute` instead of `PrivateRoute`

### 5. Media Buyer Tasks Access Control (NEW)
**Problem**: Admin users could access the Media Buyer Tasks page, which is designed specifically for Media Buyer workflows.

**Solution**: Restrict Media Buyer Tasks page to only Media Buyers, hiding it from all other users including admins.

**Changes**:
- **SidebarNavigation.tsx**: Changed from `mediaBuyerAccess: true` to `mediaBuyerOnly: true` for Media Buyer Tasks nav item
- **SidebarNavigation.tsx**: Updated filter logic to `if (item.mediaBuyerOnly && user?.position !== 'Media Buyer') return false;`
- **App.tsx**: Modified `MediaBuyerRoute` to exclude admins: `if (!user || user.position !== 'Media Buyer')`

### 6. Media Buyer Task Status Viewing and Commenting (NEW)
**Problem**: Media Buyers could assign tasks to designers but had no way to view progress, status updates, or communicate through comments.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive task detail viewing with real-time status updates and full commenting functionality.

**Changes**:
- **MediaBuyerTasksPage.tsx**: Added task detail dialog with overview and comments tabs
- **MediaBuyerTasksPage.tsx**: Integrated `TaskComments` component for full commenting functionality
- **MediaBuyerTasksPage.tsx**: Added real-time task updates using Supabase subscriptions
- **MediaBuyerTasksPage.tsx**: Enhanced task cards with progress bars, status badges, and "View Details" buttons
- **MediaBuyerTasksPage.tsx**: Added comment count indicators on task cards

### 7. **NEW - Designer Comment Notifications for Media Buyers**:
**Problem**: Media Buyers weren't getting notified when Designers commented on their assigned tasks, leading to delayed communication and poor project coordination.

**Solution**: Enhanced notification system to specifically detect and notify Media Buyers when Designers comment on their tasks, with smart routing to the correct page.

**Changes**:
- **tasksApi.ts**: Enhanced `addTaskComment()` function to detect Media Buyer → Designer task relationships
- **tasksApi.ts**: Added specialized notification titles and messages for Designer comments on Media Buyer tasks
- **tasksApi.ts**: Improved comment truncation in notifications (50 characters with ellipsis)
- **NotificationsMenu.tsx**: Updated `handleNotificationClick()` to route Media Buyers to `/media-buyer-tasks` instead of `/tasks`
- **MediaBuyerTasksPage.tsx**: Added automatic task detail dialog opening when navigating from notifications
- **MediaBuyerTasksPage.tsx**: Added `useLocation` hook to handle notification state and automatically focus on the relevant task

**New Features**:
- **Smart Notification Detection**: System now recognizes when a Designer comments on a Media Buyer's task vs. regular admin-employee task comments
- **Specialized Notification Messages**: 
  - Designer to Media Buyer: "Designer [Name] commented on your task: '[comment preview]' on '[task title]'"
  - Media Buyer to Designer: "Media Buyer commented on your task: '[comment preview]' on '[task title]'"
- **Role-Based Routing**: Notifications automatically route users to their appropriate task management interface:
  - Admin → `/tasks` (Admin Tasks Page)
  - Media Buyer → `/media-buyer-tasks` (Media Buyer Tasks Page)  
  - Other Employees → `/employee-tasks` (Employee Tasks Page)
- **Auto-Focus Feature**: When Media Buyer clicks notification, the system automatically opens the task detail dialog with the Comments tab, allowing immediate response
- **Real-Time Updates**: Media Buyers see live comment counts and status changes on their task cards
- **Sound Notifications**: Audio notification plays when new comments arrive

## Existing Protections (Already in Place)

### 1. CheckInPage.tsx
- Already has position check: `if (user.position !== 'Customer Service')`
- Shows access restricted message for non-Customer Service users

### 2. SidebarNavigation.tsx
- Check-in menu item already has `customerServiceOnly: true`
- Properly filtered out for non-Customer Service users

### 3. CheckInContext.tsx
- All check-in related functions already check for `userData.position === 'Customer Service'`
- Shift tracking, performance monitoring, and day-off checks are properly restricted

### 4. App.tsx Routing
- Check-in route uses `PrivateRoute` (general authentication)
- Actual access control is handled at component level
