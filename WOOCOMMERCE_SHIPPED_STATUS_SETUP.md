# WooCommerce Shipped Status Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to add the custom "Shipped" status to WooCommerce and ensure it syncs properly with your warehouse dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Implementation Steps

### 1. Add Code to WordPress functions.php
Copy the code from `functions.php` file in this project to your WordPress theme's `functions.php` file.

**Location**: `wp-content/themes/your-theme/functions.php`

### 2. What the Code Does

#### âœ… **Registers Custom Status**
- Adds "Shipped" as a new order status in WooCommerce
- Places it between "Processing" and "Completed" in the workflow

#### âœ… **Admin Interface Integration**
- Adds "Shipped" to order status dropdown
- Includes bulk actions to mark multiple orders as shipped
- Custom blue color styling for shipped status
- Order actions dropdown for individual orders

#### âœ… **Tracking Information**
- Adds tracking number meta box in order edit page
- Supports shipping companies: SMSA, DRB, Aramex, Other
- Displays tracking info in customer emails

#### âœ… **Customer Notifications**
- Sends automatic email when order is marked as shipped
- Shows tracking information in customer account
- Displays shipped status properly in order history

#### âœ… **Reporting Integration**

- Proper status transitions for analytics

## ðŸ”„ Auto-Sync Integration

### Status Mapping
The warehouse dashboard now properly maps statuses:

```javascript
// WooCommerce â†’ Local Dashboard
'pending' â†’ 'pending'
'processing' â†’ 'processing'  
'shipped' â†’ 'shipped'        // âœ… NEW!
'completed' â†’ 'delivered'
'cancelled' â†’ 'cancelled'
'refunded' â†’ 'refunded'
'on-hold' â†’ 'on-hold'
```

### Bidirectional Sync
- **WooCommerce â†’ Dashboard**: Shipped orders sync automatically
- **Dashboard â†’ WooCommerce**: When you mark as shipped in dashboard, WooCommerce updates too

## ðŸ“§ Email Customization

### Default Shipped Email Template
The code includes a basic shipped notification email. You can customize it by modifying the `trigger_shipped_email` function:

```php
$subject = sprintf( __( 'Your order #%s has been shipped!', 'woocommerce' ), $order->get_order_number() );
$message = sprintf( 
    __( 'Hi %s,

Your order #%s has been shipped and is on its way to you!

Order Details:
- Order Number: #%s
- Order Date: %s
- Total: %s

You can track your order status by visiting: %s

Thank you for your business!', 'woocommerce' ),
    $order->get_billing_first_name(),
    $order->get_order_number(),
    $order->get_order_number(),
    $order->get_date_created()->format( 'F j, Y' ),
    $order->get_formatted_order_total(),
    $order->get_view_order_url()
);
```

### Advanced Email Templates
For professional email templates, consider using:
- WooCommerce email template customizer
- Custom email templates in your theme
- Email builder plugins

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Customization

### Status Colors
The shipped status appears with a blue background in admin:

```css
.order-status.status-shipped {
    background: #2ea2cc;
    color: white;
}
```

### Customize Colors
To change the color, modify the `shipped_status_color()` function:

```php
function shipped_status_color() {
    echo '<style>
        .order-status.status-shipped {
            background: #your-color;  /* Change this */
            color: white;
        }
    </style>';
}
```
