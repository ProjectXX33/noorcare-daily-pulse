## üéØ Best Employee Calculation Algorithm

```javascript
comprehensiveScore = 
  (performanceScore √ó 0.4) +           // Core performance
  (punctualityBonus √ó 0.3) +           // Low delay bonus
  (overtimeHours √ó 2) +                // Overtime dedication
  (taskSuccessRate √ó 0.2) +            // Productivity
  (averageDailyHours √ó 0.1)            // Work commitment
```

**Factors Considered**:
- **Less Delay = Higher Score**: Employees with minimal delays get higher ratings
- **More Overtime = Bonus Points**: Overtime work adds significant bonus points
- **Task Success Rate**: Completion percentage boosts overall score
- **Consistent Login**: Regular app usage indicates engagement

## üìä Enhanced Employee Filter System

### Filter Options:
1. **Filter by Employee**: Dropdown with all Customer Service + Designer employees
2. **Filter by Position**: Customer Service / Designer / All
