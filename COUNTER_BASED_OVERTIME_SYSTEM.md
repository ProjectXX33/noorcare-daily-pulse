# Counter-Based Overtime System with 4AM Auto-Checkout

## Overview

The system now uses a **counter-based overtime calculation** where overtime starts ONLY after completing the required shift hours, regardless of the time of day. The work day ends at 4AM with automatic checkout.

## Key Changes

### ✅ Counter-Based Overtime Logic
- **Before**: Overtime based on time-of-day (after 4PM for day shift, after midnight for night shift)
- **After**: Overtime starts ONLY after completing required hours (7h for day, 8h for night)

### ✅ 4AM Auto-Checkout
- Work day ends at 4AM regardless of hours worked
- Automatic checkout if employee hasn't checked out by 4AM
- Prevents work sessions from extending beyond the work day boundary

## How It Works

### Day Shift (7 Hours Required)
```
✅ Hours 0-7: Regular time (counter running)
✅ Hours 7+: Overtime starts (after counter finishes)
✅ 4AM: Auto-checkout (work day ends)
```

**Example:**
- Check-in: 9:00 AM
- Work 6 hours: Still regular time (need 1 more hour)
- Work 7 hours: Counter finished, still regular time
- Work 8 hours: 1 hour overtime (7 regular + 1 overtime)
- 4:00 AM: Auto-checkout regardless of hours

### Night Shift (8 Hours Required)
```
✅ Hours 0-8: Regular time (counter running)
✅ Hours 8+: Overtime starts (after counter finishes)
✅ 4AM: Auto-checkout (work day ends)
```

**Example - Your Scenario:**
- Check-in: 4:00 PM June 19th
- Work 8 hours: 12:00 AM June 20th - Counter finished, all regular time
- Work 10 hours: 2:00 AM June 20th - 8 regular + 2 overtime
- Work until 4:00 AM: Auto-checkout (8 regular + 4 overtime max)

## Benefits

### 🎯 For Employees
- **Fair overtime**: Only get overtime after completing required work
- **No time pressure**: Can work at their own pace
- **Clear expectations**: Know exactly when overtime starts
- **4AM protection**: Can't work beyond work day boundary

### 📊 For Management
- **Guaranteed minimum hours**: Employees must complete required hours before overtime
- **Cost control**: Overtime only after work completion
- **Clear boundaries**: Work day ends at 4AM automatically
- **Consistent calculation**: Same logic for all shifts

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Overtime Detection (WorkShiftTimer.tsx)
```typescript
// NEW: Counter-based overtime
if (hoursWorked >= minimumHoursForOvertime) {
  // Completed required hours - NOW overtime starts
  setIsOvertime(true);
  const overtimeSeconds = actualWorkSeconds - (minimumHoursForOvertime * 3600);
} else {
  // Still working on required hours - no overtime yet
  setIsOvertime(false);
}
```

### 2. Auto-Checkout at 4AM
```typescript
// Auto-checkout at 4AM regardless of hours worked
if (now.getHours() === 4 && now.getMinutes() === 0) {
  handleAutoCheckout();
}
```

### 3. Calculation Logic (shiftsApi.ts)
```typescript
// Day Shift (7 hours)
if (totalHours <= 7) {
  regularHours = totalHours;
  overtimeHours = 0;
} else {
  regularHours = 7;
  overtimeHours = totalHours - 7;
}

// Night Shift (8 hours)  
if (totalHours <= 8) {
  regularHours = totalHours;
  overtimeHours = 0;
} else {
  regularHours = 8;
  overtimeHours = totalHours - 8;
}
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Day Shift - Short Day
```
Check-in:  9:00 AM
Check-out: 3:00 PM (6 hours)
Result:    6h regular, 0h overtime ✅
Reason:    Didn't complete 7 required hours
```

### Scenario 2: Day Shift - Full Day
```
Check-in:  9:00 AM  
Check-out: 4:00 PM (7 hours)
Result:    7h regular, 0h overtime ✅
Reason:    Completed exactly 7 required hours
```

### Scenario 3: Day Shift - With Overtime
```
Check-in:  9:00 AM
Check-out: 6:00 PM (9 hours)
Result:    7h regular, 2h overtime ✅
Reason:    Completed 7 required + 2 additional
```

### Scenario 4: Night Shift - Your Case
```
Check-in:  4:00 PM June 19th
Check-out: 2:00 AM June 20th (10 hours)
Result:    8h regular, 2h overtime ✅
Reason:    Completed 8 required + 2 additional
```

### Scenario 5: Night Shift - Auto Checkout
```
Check-in:  4:00 PM June 19th
Auto-out:  4:00 AM June 20th (12 hours)
Result:    8h regular, 4h overtime ✅
Reason:    Work day ended at 4AM boundary
```

## Timer Display

### Regular Time (Counter Running)
```
⏱️ 02:30:00 Remaining (Green)
   (5h 30m worked - need 2h 30m more)
```

### Overtime Mode (Counter Finished)
```
🔥 +1:30:00 OVERTIME (Red)
   (8h 30m total - 8h regular + 1h 30m overtime)
```

## Database Configuration

The system uses existing 4AM reset configuration:
```sql
-- Already configured
daily_reset_time = '04:00:00'
```

## Console Logs for Debugging

Look for these log messages:

### Regular Time
```
⏱️ REGULAR TIME (Counter-based): {
  shiftType: 'night',
  minimumHoursRequired: 8,
  hoursWorked: '6.50',
  remainingHours: '1.50',
  logic: 'Need to complete 8 hours before overtime'
}
```

### Overtime Activated
```
🔥 OVERTIME ACTIVATED (Counter-based): {
  shiftType: 'night', 
  minimumHoursRequired: 8,
  hoursWorked: '9.25',
  overtimeHours: '1.25',
  logic: 'Overtime starts after completing 8 hours'
}
```

### Auto-Checkout
```
🕐 4AM AUTO-CHECKOUT triggered
⏰ Auto checked-out at 4AM (work day reset)
```

## Files Updated

- ✅ `src/lib/shiftsApi.ts` - Counter-based calculation logic
- ✅ `src/components/WorkShiftTimer.tsx` - Counter-based overtime detection + 4AM auto-checkout
- ✅ `src/utils/verifyMonthlyShifts.js` - Verification utility updated

## Summary

The new system ensures:
1. **Overtime starts ONLY after completing required hours** (not time-based)
2. **Work day ends at 4AM with auto-checkout** (protects against endless shifts)
3. **Fair and consistent calculation** for both day and night shifts
4. **Clear expectations** for employees and management

Your night shift scenario now works perfectly: employees can work until 4AM, earning overtime only after completing their 8 required hours! 🌙✨
