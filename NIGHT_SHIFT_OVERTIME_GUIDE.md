# Night Shift Overtime Handling with 9 AM Reset

## Overview

The system now uses a **9 AM reset time** instead of midnight (12 AM) to properly handle night shift overtime. This ensures that night shift workers who work beyond midnight have their entire shift counted as one work day.

## Problem Solved

### Before (Midnight Reset)
- Night shift worker checks in at 4 PM on June 2nd
- Works until 3 AM on June 3rd (11 hours total)
- **Problem**: Midnight reset would split this into two separate work days
- Check-in counted for June 2nd, check-out counted for June 3rd
- Overtime calculation was broken

### After (9 AM Reset)
- Night shift worker checks in at 4 PM on June 2nd  
- Works until 3 AM on June 3rd (11 hours total)
- **Solution**: Both check-in and check-out count as the same work day
- Work day runs from June 2nd 9 AM to June 3rd 9 AM
- Overtime properly calculated as 3 hours (11 total - 8 regular = 3 overtime)

## How It Works

### Work Day Boundaries
The system defines a "work day" as the period between two consecutive 9 AM reset times:

```
Work Day Example:
â”œâ”€â”€ June 2nd 9:00 AM (Start of work day)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM: Day Shift Period
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 4:00 PM - 12:00 AM: Night Shift Period  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 12:00 AM - 9:00 AM: Night Shift Overtime Period
â””â”€â”€ June 3rd 9:00 AM (End of work day / Start of next work day)
```

### Current Time Logic
- **Before 9 AM**: You're still in "yesterday's" work day
- **After 9 AM**: You're in "today's" work day

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Night Shift with Overtime
```
âœ… Check-in:  June 2nd, 4:00 PM  (Work Day: June 2nd 9AM â†’ June 3rd 9AM)
âœ… Check-out: June 3rd, 3:00 AM  (Same Work Day: June 2nd 9AM â†’ June 3rd 9AM)
âœ… Result: 11 hours on same work day (8 regular + 3 overtime)
```

#### Scenario 2: Early Morning Check-in (Before Reset)
```
âœ… Current Time: June 3rd, 7:00 AM
âœ… Work Day: June 2nd 9AM â†’ June 3rd 9AM (still yesterday's work day)
âœ… If checking in: Would count for June 2nd work day
```

#### Scenario 3: Normal Day Shift
```
âœ… Check-in:  June 2nd, 9:00 AM  (Work Day: June 2nd 9AM â†’ June 3rd 9AM)
âœ… Check-out: June 2nd, 5:00 PM  (Same Work Day: June 2nd 9AM â†’ June 3rd 9AM)  
âœ… Result: 8 hours on same work day (8 regular + 0 overtime)
```

## Implementation Details

### Database Configuration
The reset time is stored in the `work_time_config` table:
```sql
daily_reset_time TIME NOT NULL DEFAULT '09:00:00'
```

### Functions Updated
- `hasCheckedInToday()` - Now uses 9 AM work day boundaries
- `hasCheckedOutToday()` - Now uses 9 AM work day boundaries  
- `checkInUser()` - Prevents duplicate check-ins within same work day
- `checkOutUser()` - Finds check-in within same work day for checkout

### Automatic Boundary Updates
- Work day boundaries are loaded when the app starts
- Boundaries refresh every hour to handle day transitions
- Fallback to midnight logic if boundaries can't be loaded

## Benefits

### For Night Shift Workers
- âœ… Overtime properly tracked across midnight
- âœ… No split work days
- âœ… Accurate performance tracking
- âœ… Fair compensation calculation

### For Administrators  
- âœ… Better overtime reporting
- âœ… Accurate shift performance metrics
- âœ… Proper labor cost tracking
- âœ… Compliance with labor regulations

### For System Reliability
- âœ… Graceful fallback to midnight logic if needed
- âœ… Automatic boundary refresh
- âœ… Console logging for debugging
- âœ… Error handling for edge cases

## Configuration

The daily reset time can be changed by updating the `work_time_config` table:

```sql
UPDATE work_time_config 
SET daily_reset_time = '09:00:00' 
WHERE name = 'default';
```

**Note**: Changes require app restart to take effect, or wait up to 1 hour for automatic refresh.

## Testing the Feature

You can verify the feature is working by:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for "ðŸ“… Work day boundaries" messages
2. **Test Check-ins**: Try checking in during different times
3. **Monitor Overtime**: Verify overtime calculation across midnight
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Check performance tracking accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### If 9 AM Reset Not Working
1. Check `work_time_config` table has correct `daily_reset_time`
2. Look for error messages in browser console
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Check if fallback midnight logic is being used

### Common Issues
- **Duplicate check-ins**: System prevents multiple check-ins in same work day
- **Missing check-out**: System finds check-in within same work day
- **Wrong overtime**: Verify shift end times and duration calculations

## Technical Notes

- Uses UTC timestamps internally for consistency
- Local timezone handling for display purposes  
- Graceful degradation if database is unavailable
- Memory-efficient with hourly boundary refresh
- Compatible with existing midnight-based data
